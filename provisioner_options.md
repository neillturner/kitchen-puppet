# Puppet Apply Install Options

Kitchen-puppet is very flexible in how it installs puppet:

It installs it in the following order:

* if require_puppet_omnibus is set to true

   Installs using the omnibus_puppet script and passes the puppet_version if specied as -v option.

* If require_puppet_collections is set to true (the default)

   Installs from the puppet collection.
   This is required if you wish to install puppet version 4 or 5.

   You get the version of puppet in the collection. To influence which puppet version is install modify either
   * puppet_yum_collections_repo
   * puppet_apt_collections_repo
   to an new collection. At time of writing there are only 2 collections PC1 and puppet5.

* if require_puppet_repo is set to true

   Installs from the operation system repository with the puppet version that is in the particular repository.

## Puppet Apply Configuring Provisioner Options

The provisioner can be configured globally or per suite, global settings act as defaults for all suites, you can then customise per suite, for example:

```yaml
    ---
    driver:
      name: vagrant

    provisioner:
      name: puppet_apply
      manifests_path: /repository/puppet_repo/manifests
      modules_path: /repository/puppet_repo/modules-mycompany
      hiera_data_path: /repository/puppet_repo/hieradata

    platforms:
    - name: nocm_ubuntu-12.04
      driver_plugin: vagrant
      driver_config:
        box: nocm_ubuntu-12.04
        box_url: http://puppet-vagrant-boxes.puppetlabs.com/ubuntu-server-12042-x64-vbox4210-nocm.box

    suites:
     - name: default
```

**NOTE:** With Test-Kitchen 1.4 you not longer need chef install to run the tests. You just need ruby installed version 1.9 or higher and also add to the .kitchen.yml file

```yaml
  verifier:
    ruby_bindir: '/usr/bin'
```
where /usr/bin is the location of the ruby command.

in this example, vagrant will download a box for ubuntu 1204 with no configuration management installed, then install the
latest puppet and puppet apply against a puppet repo from the /repository/puppet_repo directory using the defailt manifest site.pp

To override a setting at the suite-level, specify the setting name under the suite:

```yaml
    suites:
     - name: default
       provisioner:
         manifest: foobar.pp
```

#### custom_install_command example usage

* One liner
```yaml
    custom_install_command: yum install -y git
```
* Multiple lines, a.k.a embed shell script
```yaml
  custom_install_command: |
     command1
     command2
```
* Multiple lines join without new line
```yaml
  custom_install_command: >
     command1 &&
     command2
```

### Per-suite Structure

It can be beneficial to keep different Puppet layouts for different suites. Rather than having to specify the manifest, modules, etc for each suite, you can create the following directory structure and they will automatically be found:

    $kitchen_root/puppet/$suite_name/manifests
    $kitchen_root/puppet/$suite_name/modules
    $kitchen_root/puppet/$suite_name/hiera
    $kitchen_root/puppet/$suite_name/hiera.yaml
    $kitchen_root/puppet/$suite_name/Puppetfile

### Puppet Version
When specifying a puppet version, you must use this format: "3.6.2-1puppetlabs1". I have
no idea why Puppet versioned their repository with a trailing
"-1puppetlabs1", but there it is.


### eyaml

See https://puppet.com/blog/encrypt-your-data-using-hiera-eyaml

See https://blog.benroberts.net/2014/12/setting-up-hiera-eyaml-gpg for using GPG backend allowing secrets to be protected using asymmetric keys.

## Puppet Agent Configuring Provisioner Options

The provisioner can be configured globally or per suite, global settings act as defaults for all suites, you can then customise per suite, for example:

```yaml
    ---
    driver:
      name: vagrant

    provisioner:
      name: puppet_agent
      puppet_debug: true
      puppet_verbose: true
      puppet_server:  puppetmaster-nocm-ubuntu-1204

    platforms:
    - name: nocm_ubuntu-12.04
      driver_plugin: vagrant
      driver_config:
        box: nocm_ubuntu-12.04
        box_url: http://puppet-vagrant-boxes.puppetlabs.com/ubuntu-server-12042-x64-vbox4210-nocm.box

    suites:
     - name: default
```

**NOTE:** With Test-Kitchen 1.4 you not longer need chef install to run the tests. You just need ruby installed version 1.9 or higher and also add to the .kitchen.yml file

```yaml
  verifier:
    ruby_bindir: '/usr/bin'
```
where /usr/bin is the location of the ruby command.

In this example, vagrant will download a box for ubuntu 1204 with no configuration management installed, then install the latest puppet and run puppet agent against a puppet master at puppetmaster-nocm-ubuntu-1204

NOTE: It is important that the server can resolve the hostname ip address of the puppetmaster, in this case puppetmaster-nocm-ubuntu-1204
and the puppetmaster must be able to resolve the hostname ip address address of the hostname of the node running puppet agent.
This can be done by settings in the /etc/hosts files before running puppet.

NOTE: For testing it is possible to set the puppetmaster to autosign the certificate of a node by created a file /etc/puppet/autosign.conf that contains an *.


To override a setting at the suite-level, specify the setting name under the suite:

```yaml
    suites:
     - name: default
       provisioner:
         manifest: foobar.pp
```

## Custom ServerSpec or Beaker Invocation

 Instead of using the busser use a custom serverspec invocation using [shell verifier](https://github.com/higanworks/kitchen-verifier-shell) to call it.
With such setup there is no dependency on busser and any other chef library.

Also you can specify you tests in a different directory structure or even call [beaker](https://github.com/puppetlabs/beaker) instead of server spec and have tests in beaker structure

Using a structure like
```yaml
verifier:
  name: shell
  remote_exec: true
  command: |
    sudo -s <<SERVERSPEC
    cd /opt/gdc/serverspec-core
    export SERVERSPEC_ENV=$EC2DATA_ENVIRONMENT
    export SERVERSPEC_BACKEND=exec
    serverspec junit=true tag=~skip_in_kitchen check:role:$EC2DATA_TYPE
    SERVERSPEC
```

where `serverspec` is a wrapper around `rake` invocation.
Use a `Rakefile` similar to one in https://github.com/vincentbernat/serverspec-example.

With such approach we can achieve flexibility of running same test suite both in test kitchen and actual, even production, instances.

Beware: kitchen-shell-verifier is not yet merged into test-kitchen upstream so using separate gem is unavoidable so far

## Checking puppet apply success (with puppet_detailed_exitcodes)

If you do not enable puppet_detailed_exitcodes, the provisioner only failes if the manifest can not be compiled. If the manifest contains errors (some manifests can not be executed) puppet will return exit 0 and thus the provisioner will be successfull, altought your catalog has not been fully applied. Probably this is not what you want.

When you enable `puppet_detailed_exitcodes`, you can specify the error conditions to check for with `puppet_whitelist_exit_code` also, otherwise the provisioner will fail altought everything is fine (and changes have been made).

Puppet will return with one of the following codes (see https://docs.puppet.com/puppet/latest/man/agent.html) when `puppet_detailed_exitcodes` is true:

* 0: The run succeeded with no changes or failures; the system was already in the desired state.
* 1: The run failed, or wasn't attempted due to another run already in progress.
* 2: The run succeeded, and some resources were changed.
* 4: The run succeeded, and some resources failed.
* 6: The run succeeded, and included both changes and failures.

If you enable `puppet_detailed_exitcodes` you should should probably set `puppet_whitelist_exit_code` to 0 and 2

```yaml
provisioner:
  puppet_detailed_exitcodes: true
  puppet_whitelist_exit_code:
    - 0
    - 2
```

# Puppet Bolt Provisioner Options
